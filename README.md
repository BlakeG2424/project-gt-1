## We, Pour Decisions, are a Sales & Marketing Consultant serving the Russian Food and Beverage sector.

Weâ€™re conducting a study aimed at predicting alcohol consumption trends based on key economic indicators. We will 
analyze alcohol consumption data from 85 regions in Russia during the years 1998-2016. Our dataset contains info on
the sale of wine, beer, vodka, champagne, and brandy per capita, per year, and per region. We will analyze total 
alcohol consumption by region and by type. We will also consider the unemployment rate and GDP in Russia during the
years 1998-2016 to determine if there are any correlations with the amount of alcohol consumed.
