Three principal types of activities are identified:\\n\\nRaising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and, in the process, incurring liabilities. Establishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans and/or purchasing securities. Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale and risk. This activity is known as financial intermediation.\\n\\nPooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities. Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees, insurance premiums, or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual payments. Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment.\\n\\nProviding specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation, insurance, and employee benefit programs.\\n\\nIn addition, monetary authorities charged with monetary control are included in this sector.\\n\\nConsists of all counties in a state that are parts of metropolitan statistical areas.\\n\\nFor more information about this release go to http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/gdp_metro_newsrelease.htm.'},\n",
